use Email system easily. The proposed system focuses on providing the basic functionalities like composing,
reading, sending and receiving emails along with voice based interaction. This facilitates working with each of the
above features as well as the provision for sending text as well as voice based email. The proposed system allows
blind people to use Email system easily. As the input to the system does not use keyboard or mouse, users can easily
give input by speaking the message. Thus, the system that we are developing is entirely different from the existing
ones. Unlike other systems which focus only on a particular set of people, our system is focused on visually
challenged people too. The user will be able to give commands to the system, which, the system will follow.
Moreover, the system will prompt the user to perform specific actions to avail respective services.
